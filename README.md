# Gadfly Flutter Template

This is for personal use, so I don't recommend using it. It is not documented and it is subject to change.

## Usage

```sh
./create_app.sh <entire flutter command>

# example:
# ./create_app.sh flutter create my_app
```

Then cd into the `projects/my_app` directory and open the `README.md`.
